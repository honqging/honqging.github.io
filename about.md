> Hey! Here is a brief introduction of my experience, and you can have my [resume]({{site.baseurl}}/public/static/Resume_QingHong.pdf) here.

## Minneapolis, MN
My name is Qing Hong, (or just Kevin). Currently I am a first-year graduate student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umn.edu/) at [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), and I am actively seeking for *summer internship in 2018* nowadays.

## Shanghai, China
I have much experiece in programming and implementing practical projects when I was pursuing bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at [Tongji University](http://en.tongji.edu.cn/) in China.

During then, I had two internships at *Xiaoguo Tech* and *Perkin Elmer*, Inc respectively, where I applied what I learned at school to real usage and inspired me to be a better Software Engineer in the future. You can have my professional experience at [LinkedIn](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/qing-hong-76bab284).


## Hong Kong
One more thing I'd like to tell is my Exchange Experience in Department of Computing at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), where I love very very very much, both PolyU and Hong Kong. This is my first time to touch a new study system outside China Mainland and the exciting months there apparently broadened my horizon and some new friends I met there are really awesome. I have written [some words]({{site.baseurl}}/experience/2017/07/27/红磡四月&半/) trying to remember that, but I know only my heart will know that clearly.
